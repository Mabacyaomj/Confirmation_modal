This HTML file creates a simple confirmation modal using Tailwind CSS for styling. The modal appears centered on the screen with a semi-transparent background when triggered. It includes a message indicating that the profile has been updated successfully, along with a check icon for visual confirmation. The modal contains a close button in the top-right corner to dismiss it.

Initially, the modal is hidden using Tailwind's hidden class. A "Confirm" button on the main page triggers the modal's visibility by removing the hidden class. Clicking the close button within the modal hides it again by re-adding the hidden class. The code uses basic JavaScript to toggle the modalâ€™s visibility, ensuring a smooth user experience. All styles are handled by Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.
